Memory Game Project

Project Overview

This project is one of the earlier React assignments in The Odin Project curriculum. The objective was to build a functional Memory Game that integrates API data handling, React state management, and interactive gameplay. While the technical focus was on using React's useState and useEffect hooks effectively, the goal was also to create an engaging and enjoyable game.




Key Features

Deck of Cards API: Used to dynamically fetch and display playing cards for the game.

Framer Motion: Implemented smooth flip animations for the cards, enhancing the user experience.

React Howler: Integrated background music and sound effects for a more immersive experience.

Custom Video Clips: Added short, cinematic video clips generated with Sora to enhance the game's atmosphere.

Video Playback Manipulation: Modified video playback speed using custom React components to create suspenseful transitions.

Responsive Design: Designed to work across various devices (desktop, tablet), with ongoing improvements for mobile compatibility.




Technologies Used

React for UI components and state management

Framer Motion for card animations

React Howler for sound integration

Deck of Cards API for game data

CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout

Vite for fast development and build processes

Challenges and Solutions

Card Scaling and Responsiveness: Implemented clamp() and optimized media queries to ensure smooth scaling across different screen sizes.

Video Playback Customization: Used custom components to slow down video endings when Sora video credits were exhausted.

Sound Integration: Leveraged React Howler for seamless sound effect toggling and background music.

Future Improvements

Mobile Compatibility: Currently working on resolving issues with cinematic assets not loading on mobile devices.

Enhanced Error Handling: Additional error feedback for smoother user experience during network/API issues.

Performance Optimization: Further reducing video and image load times for better performance on slower connections.
